# Implementation Notes

Live observations from probing YCL on 2026-05-07. These findings drove
the plugin's API-only architecture — they replaced everything the
original PLAN.md guessed about the auth flow, the URL shape, and the
content delivery format.

Probe scripts live in `scripts/probe_*.py`; raw output in `scratch/probe-*.json`.

## URL anatomy

| URL                                                                              | What                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://epub.yourcloudlibrary.com/read/{book_id}`                               | The reader URL. **302-redirects** to the detail page, even when authed. |
| `https://ebook.yourcloudlibrary.com/library/{LIBRARY_SLUG}/detail/{book_id}`     | Book detail page. Wrong slug → bounces to marketing.                  |
| `…/detail/{book_id}?_data=routes/library.$name.detail.$id`                       | Remix loader. Returns JSON with the ISBN, title, status, canRead, page count. |
| `https://epubservice.yourcloudlibrary.com/manifest/{ISBN}?catalogName=3m.us`     | Returns a JSON-encoded URL string pointing at the actual manifest.    |
| `https://epubservice.yourcloudlibrary.com/content/{book-uuid}/manifest.json`     | Readium WebPub manifest (standard W3C format).                        |
| `https://epubservice.yourcloudlibrary.com/content/{book-uuid}/{href}`            | Each `readingOrder[i].href` chapter — base64-wrapped XHTML.           |

`{LIBRARY_SLUG}` example: `PalmBeachCountyLibrarySystem`. The slug is
**not** the user's library card number (which the user's `.env` had
called `LIBRARY_ID`); see "Cookies" below for where the slug actually
comes from.

`{book_id}` is opaque (e.g. `onc5689`). The prefix is **not** a library
code — `/library/onc/featured` bounces to marketing. Treat it as an
opaque vendor identifier.

`catalogName=3m.us` is the legacy Bibliotheca/3M backend identifier. It
appears stable for US libraries; non-US may differ — left as a hardcoded
default in `ycl/api/client.py::DEFAULT_CATALOG_NAME`.

## Cookies — the source of truth

After login, the YCL server sets six cookies on `.yourcloudlibrary.com`.
Three carry useful state:

- **`__session_PROD`** — the actual JWT-bearing session cookie (httponly,
  secure, ~30-day expiry).
- **`__config_PROD`** — base64-encoded JSON with library identity:
  ```json
  {
    "library_info": {
      "name": "Palm Beach County Library System",
      "urlName": "PalmBeachCountyLibrarySystem",
      "url": "https://ebook.yourcloudlibrary.com/library/PalmBeachCountyLibrarySystem"
    },
    "library_config": {"reaktor_patron_id": 203592612},
    "login_info": {"barcode": "D027150451", "library": "<UUID>", "state": "FL"}
  }
  ```
  **The cookie body has trailing binary noise after the JSON.** Decoding
  with `rfind('}')` is wrong — that brace may be inside the noise. Use
  `json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode(text[start:])` instead. There's a
  regression test for this in `test_api_cookies.py`.
- **`__mads_PROD`** — patron identity (`patronId`, internal IDs). Not
  currently used by the plugin but worth preserving in the cookie file
  in case future endpoints need it.

The plugin does not require any environment variables for identity. The
slug, library UUID, patron id, and state are all derived from the cookie
at runtime via `ycl.api.cookies.decode_config_cookie`.

## Content format — Readium WebPub, no DRM

The manifest is a standard
[W3C Readium WebPub Manifest](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/):

```json
{
  "@context": "https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/context.jsonld",
  "metadata": {"title": "...", "identifier": "9780310522744", "author": [...]},
  "readingOrder": [
    {"type": "application/xhtml+xml", "href": "OEBPS/chapter01.xhtml"},
    ...
  ],
  "resources": [...],
  "toc": [...],
  "pageList": [...]
}
```

Each `readingOrder` href is fetched as a separate HTTP GET. The
response body is **base64-encoded XHTML** — superficial obfuscation, not
real DRM. Decoding is one `base64.b64decode` call per chapter.

The XHTML is well-formed (Innodata-generated); Python's stdlib
`html.parser` handles it fine. No need for bs4 or lxml.

## Auth flow — one-time browser, headless thereafter

1. **First-time login** is unavoidable in a browser because each library
   uses its own auth (card+PIN, SSO, library-card-only, etc.). The CLI at
   `ycl/cli/login.py` opens Chromium at `https://www.yourcloudlibrary.com/`
   and polls every 3 s for the YCL session cookies (`__session_PROD` +
   `__config_PROD`) to appear. Once they do, it saves them and exits.
2. **All subsequent operations** are plain async httpx using the saved
   cookies. There's no second browser launch.
3. **When cookies expire** (401, or a 200 that bounced to marketing), the
   client raises `AuthExpiredError` with a hint to re-run the login CLI.
   `ycl.auth_status` reports the same state proactively.

## Performance

End-to-end smoke test (`scripts/probe_auth.py` cookies + new YclClient):

- 27 readingOrder items (cover + frontmatter + 17 chapters + appendices)
- **1.92 seconds** to scrape the full book at concurrency=4
- 484,789 characters of plain text out
- 0 anti-bot challenges, 0 page-turn delays

The old browser-based design would have taken ~10 minutes for the same
book. The API-only path is ~300x faster.

## Active-loans endpoint (added 2026-06-29)

Live findings that drove `ycl.sync_loans` and `YclClient.get_loans`. Probed
by injecting the saved session cookies into a real browser and watching the
My-Books page traffic (the loan list is fetched client-side after hydration,
not server-rendered, so it doesn't appear in the initial HTML).

**The loans list is a Remix _action_ (POST), not a `_data` loader GET.** This
was the key surprise — the obvious guess (a GET loader mirroring `get_book`)
does not work:

- `GET …/library/{slug}/mybooks?_data=routes/library.$name.mybooks`
  → **400** with header `x-remix-error: yes`. The `mybooks` route has **no
  server loader** (the page's `__remixContext.loaderData` contains only
  `root`), so requesting loader data for it errors.
- The real call is on the `.current` child route:

  ```
  POST https://ebook.yourcloudlibrary.com/library/{slug}/mybooks/current
       ?segment=1&pageSize=20&_data=routes/library.$name.mybooks.current
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  body: format=&sort=BorrowedDateDescending
  ```

  Response:

  ```json
  {
    "patronItems": [
      {"itemId": "onc5689", "loanId": "...", "title": "...",
       "author": "...", "mediaType": "Epub", "dueDate": "<ISO 8601>",
       "canRenew": true, "canReturn": true, "isSaved": false}
    ],
    "totalSegments": 1, "currentSegment": 1, "itemsPerSegment": 20,
    "totalItems": 1, "RPC_DOMAIN_PUBLIC": "...", "reaktor": "..."
  }
  ```

- `dueDate` is the **authoritative loan expiry** (the value the web UI counts
  down from — `moment(dueDate).diff(now, "days")`). `sync_loans` writes it
  straight into `expires_at` with `expires_at_is_estimated=False`.
- Pagination is by `segment` (1-based) up to `totalSegments`; `get_loans`
  walks every segment. Most patrons are well under one page.

Replay it with `scripts/probe_loans.py`. **Assumption to revisit:** the exact
field names above were confirmed against the `.current` route's client bundle
and a live (empty) response on Palm Beach County Library System; a library on
a different web-app build could rename fields. The parser tolerates a missing
`author`/`loanId` and an epoch-format `dueDate`, and skips items without an
`itemId`.

## Author / subjects (added 2026-06-29)

The detail-page loader (`get_book`) already returned far more than the
plugin used. Confirmed live, it carries:

- `contributors`: a list of `{"name": ...}`. A single entry can itself be a
  `"Last, First; Last, First; …"` string. `_extract_author` joins the names
  and trims a trailing `,`/`;`.
- `contentCategories`: a dict keyed by opaque id, each value with a
  human-readable `name` (e.g. `"Ecclesiology"`, `"Missions"`). Flattened to a
  de-duplicated `subjects` list.
- `description`: the jacket blurb (contains HTML).

These now flow into the `Book` dataclass and the `ingest_book` metadata so the
corpus is searchable by author/subject.

## Catalog search — same Remix-loader trick (probed 2026-06-29)

Confirmed live with `scripts/probe_search.py` / `probe_search_live.py`:

| URL | What |
| --- | --- |
| `…/library/{SLUG}/search?query={q}&_data=routes/library.$name.search` | Search loader. **200 `application/json`**, top-level keys `results`, `categories`, `segment`, `action`, `advanced`. |

- The hit list is nested under `results.search`. Other live params the UI
  sends (all optional, empty = "no filter"): `format`, `available` (`any` /
  `available`), `language`, `sort`, `orderBy` (spelled `relevence` upstream),
  `owned=yes`. There is **no** separate backend call — the loader *is* the
  search endpoint (capturing all cross-host requests showed only the document
  + this one fetch; `categories` come back fully populated in the same body).
- **Caveat:** the only session available for probing was ~7 weeks old and every
  query returned zero hits (the rendered page agreed: "No titles match"), so the
  *populated* result-item shape could not be captured. `ycl.api.client._parse_search_results`
  is therefore written defensively against cloudLibrary's documented book-document
  convention — `itemId` / `title` / `contributors[].name` / `canBorrow` (the same
  fields the detail loader returns, see `get_book`) — and falls back to the first
  list-of-dicts under `results.search` if the container key differs. If the live
  shape turns out different, the fix is localized to that one function.

## What is *not* covered yet

- **Audiobooks**. Detail page reports `mediaType: "Audiobook"` for those.
  The manifest endpoint may or may not work for them; not tested. `get_loans`
  *will* list an audiobook loan (with its `mediaType`), but scraping it will
  still fail at the manifest step.
- **Comics+ / BiblioPlus**. Same library can have multiple sub-services.
  The plugin currently only handles the standard ebook path.
- **Re-borrow versioning**. Plugin treats re-borrows as new documents
  (Kindle convention); could change to per-borrow versioning.
